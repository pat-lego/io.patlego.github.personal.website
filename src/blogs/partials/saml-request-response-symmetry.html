            <p class="m-5">I think SAML is probably one of the most complex things to setup in any given application,
                all the configurations that need to be just right or else the whole thing falls a part. The part that
                makes it complex is the amount of data that needs to perfectly match between system or else it will
                fail. Interestingly enough I had a customer who had all the configurations match perfectly between
                systems but the authentication still failed.</p>

            <p class="m-5">The customer was experiencing the following error:</p>

            <p class="m-5">Now I have been working with AEM for a long time and let me tell you that message is not
                intuitive. That being said I can help you understand why this message is the key to understanding why
                this is the reason why the SAML auth is failing. When AEM gets a request to a path it needs to do 2
                things. The first thing is to authenticate it and the second is to execute the "script" that is linked
                to that path.</p>

            <p class="m-5">Now for publish instances a lot of the endpoints (i.e paths) are not expecting
                authentication, the Apache Sling Authentication Service is typically only expecting authentication on a
                subset of paths. This means is a request to /saml_login comes in but there is no rule in the Apache
                Sling Authentication Service saying <span class="italic">+/</span> then the path will not require to be
                authenticated. Note that if the Allow Anonymous Access is checked then the user will not require to be
                authenticated and be authenticated as the anonymous user.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="m-5">Now coming back to our customers issue, the endpoint /saml_login as mentioned in the error
                did not require authentication and allowed the Anonymous User, so that means we get to skip
                authentication. Meaning the only part left is to execute the script, except what script would execute a
                POST request to /saml_login? The default one of course! The <a class="hover:text-blue-500 underline"
                    href="https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-servlets-post/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/post/impl/SlingPostServlet.java"
                    target="_blank">Apache Sling Post Servlet</a> of course! This explains why the Sling Post request
                processed the request, the saml_login was not handled due to the incorrectly configured Apache Sling
                Authentication Service which prevented the authentication to even get processed.</p>

            <p class="m-5">Ok, so we fix it, we add the <span class="italic">+/</span> and disable Allow Anonymous
                Access, and test again.</p>

                The test results are in, and it failed. <span class="font-bold">AGAIN</span>
            </p>

            <p class="m-5">
                After some examination and careful thinking, I realized that the SAML request was not going back to the initial request. <span class="italic">Spoiler alert this is where the title of this blog starts to make sense.</span>. Let's say you have enabled SAML auth on the following pages
            </p>
            <div class="m-5 flex justify-center">
                <ul>
                    <li>/content/site_1/pages/login</li>
                    <li>/content/site_3/pages/login</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="m-5">
                This means that a user goes to <span class="italic">/content/site_1/pages/login</span> and then performs some action that triggers the SAML authentication process. The expectaction is that the SAML response from the IdP (Identity Provider) is to come back to the originating SAML enabled URL with the suffix <span class="italic">/saml_login</span>.  This means that the SAML response should be sent to <span class="italic">/content/site_1/pages/login/saml_login</span>. This is where the symmetry comes in, the SAML response needs to go back to the originating URL and not some other URL.
            </p>
            <p class="m-5">
                Once the necessary changes were made to the IdP to send the response back to the originating request with a suffix of <span class="italic">/saml_login</span> the authentication process worked as expected.
